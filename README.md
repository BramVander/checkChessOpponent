Because there is no endpoint for cheatdata, I HAVE to make a request per opponent.
This makes the check pretty slow when you play alot of opponents.

Check:

- streamers you played against
- check twitch channel from streamers you played against
- check suspicious players
- check specific games vs opponents
- stats
- practice your board precision!
