Cheaters caught: may 2023

Because there is no endpoint for cheatdata, I HAVE to make a request per opponent.
This makes the check pretty slow when you play alot of opponents.

App I made in React with Chess.com API.
Check:
- cheaters
- streamers
- suspicious players
- stats
- more comming...

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
