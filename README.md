If you don't have an account, use the example account on chess.com for Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura: hikaru

Because there is no endpoint for cheatdata, I HAVE to make a request per opponent.
This makes the check pretty slow when you play alot of opponents.

App I made in React with Chess.com API.
Check:

- cheaters you played against
- streamers you played against
- twitch channel from streamers you played against
- suspicious players
- specific games vs opponents
- stats

& practice your board precision!

Upcomming

- check for formats individually: chess960 daily, blitz, bullet, daily, rapid, puzzle rush, tactics, lessons
  (this will decrease loading times as well)
