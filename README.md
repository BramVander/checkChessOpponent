If you don't have an account, use mine: bramvander (cheaters caught: may 2023)
or the example account on chess.com from Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura: hikaru

Because there is no endpoint for cheatdata, I HAVE to make a request per opponent.
This makes the check pretty slow when you play alot of opponents.

App I made in React with Chess.com API.
Check:
- cheaters
- streamers
- suspicious players
- stats

More coming:
- loading minigame
- check specific game vs cheaters
